# Simple-BuyOne-GetOneFree-ForWooCommerce
Simple buy one-get one free (and buy any get one free) plug-in for WooCommerce, that allows, as the name implies, two things:
- for a given product, configure another one to be granted for free (regardless of the quantity the trigger product the customer has bought);
- configure a given product to be granted for free (regardless of what the customer has placed in his or her cart);
- combine these two behaviors.

Additionally, the plug-in allows one to configure the messages displayed in the products that:
- serve as trigger for free products;
- are granted for free when any other product is bought.

# Requirements
- WordPress 6.0.0 or greater;
- WooCommerce 5.0.0 or greater;
- PHP 7.4.0 or greater.
